  Provides low &amp; high-level introspective services.

  <h2><a name="low">Low level</a></h2>
  <p>
  The IntrospectorBase, Introspector, ClassMap, IntrospectionUtils form the
  base of the introspection service. They allow to describe classes and their
  methods, keeping them in a cache (@see Introspector) to speed up property
  getters/setters and method discovery used during expression evaluation.
  </p>
  <p>
  The cache materialized in Introspector creates one entry per class containing a map of all
  accessible public methods keyed by name and signature.
  </p>

  <h2><a name="high">High level</a></h2>
  
  <p>
  The Uberspect, VelMethod, VelPropertyGet and VelPropertySet interfaces
  form the exposed face of introspective services.
  </p>
  <p>
  The Uberspectimpl is the concrete class implementing the Uberspect interface.
  Deriving from this class is the preferred way of augmenting Jexl introspective
  capabilities when special needs to be fullfilled or when default behaviors
  need to be modified.
